# The Human ReadMe Protocol

=======================================================================

"We have user manuals for toasters. Where's yours?"

The Human ReadMe Protocol is an open-source framework designed to bridge the communication gap between complex patients and medical providers, as well as between neurodivergent individuals and the standard operating systems of the workplace and relationships.

It was born out of the exhaustion of having to explain a "Live Wire" operating system (High-Velocity, High-Sensitivity) to a world built for standard processing.

The Goal:
To bypass the friction of the intake process and establish a high-bandwidth connection immediately.

What's Included?
- The Template: A standardized, blank "User Manual" for patients to fill out and hand to providers.
- The System Architecture: A breakdown of the "Live Wire" cognitive profile vs. the "Standard OS."
- Communication Protocols: Specific "Do's and Don'ts" for interacting with high-sensitivity nervous systems to prevent system crashes (anxiety/shutdown).

How to Use
- Download the Template (PDF or Markdown).
- Fill it out with your specific data points (Pain signals, Sensory triggers, Communication needs).
- Hand it to your doctor, therapist, or partner.
- Update as your system patches itself.
