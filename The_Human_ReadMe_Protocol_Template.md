# **THE PERSONAL READ-ME: A PATIENT INTERFACE PROTOCOL**

Name: \[Patient Name\]  
Version: 1.0  
Date: \[Insert Date\]  
**Objective:** To provide providers with a high-velocity overview of the patient's operating system, communication needs, and internal landscape to reduce friction and improve care.

## **1\. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (Who I Am)**

*How my brain and body process the world.*

* **Operating System Type:**  
  * \[ \] **Standard:** Balanced sensory processing, linear thinking.  
  * \[ \] **High-Sensitivity ("Live Wire"):** Amplified sensory input, high-velocity association, requires low-noise environment.  
  * \[ \] **Survivor:** Trauma-informed responses, hyper-vigilance ("Sentry Duty").  
* **Communication Protocol:**  
  * **Input Style:** Do you need \[ \] Direct Data, \[ \] Gentle Metaphors, or \[ \] The "Why" explained first?  
  * **Output Style:** I tend to \[ \] Info-Dump (Surplus), \[ \] Shut Down (Freeze), or \[ \] Intellectualize (Theorize).  
* **Known Glitches:**  
  * *Example: "I laugh when I'm in pain." / "I go silent when I am overwhelmed." / "I ask complex questions to manage anxiety."*

## **2\. HARDWARE DIAGNOSTICS (The Body)**

*Beyond the chart diagnosis—how it actually feels.*

* **The Pain Signal:**  
  * **My "10" is:** *\[Describe your worst state, e.g., "Non-verbal, rocking, vision blurring"\]*  
  * **My "Baseline" is:** *\[e.g., "Always a dull roar in the background"\]*  
* **Sensory Triggers:**  
  * *List triggers that cause a system crash (e.g., Fluorescent lights, rapid-fire questions, being touched without warning).*  
* **Anesthesia/Medication Response:**  
  * *Example: "I have a high tolerance." / "I taste IV meds strongly." / "I wake up fighting."*

## **3\. THE USER MANUAL (How to Treat Me)**

*Directives for the Provider.*

* **DO:**  
  * *\[e.g., Explain the mechanism of action.\]*  
  * *\[e.g., Give me 30 seconds to process before asking for a response.\]*  
  * *\[e.g., Believe my description of pain even if I look calm.\]*  
* **DO NOT:**  
  * *\[e.g., Tell me to "just relax."\]*  
  * *\[e.g., Dismiss my theories/research as "Googling."\]*  
  * *\[e.g., Use a condescending tone.\]*

## **4\. THE "GHOST IN THE MACHINE" (Context)**

*What else is running in the background that affects my health?*

* **Current Load:** *\[e.g., "I am caring for a sick parent" / "I am managing high-stress work."\]*  
* **Core Motivation:** *\[e.g., "I want to be able to play with my kids." / "I want to get back to work."\]*  
* **The "Safe Mode":** *\[What helps you reset? e.g., "Silence," "Music," "Deep Pressure."\]*
